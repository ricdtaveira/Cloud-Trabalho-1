block-device-mapping.volume-size - The volume size of the EBS volume, in GiB.
block-device-mapping.volume-type - The volume type of the EBS volume (gp2 | standard | io1 ).
description - The description of the image (provided during image creation).
hypervisor - The hypervisor type (ovm | xen ).
image-id - The ID of the image.
image-type - The image type (machine | kernel | ramdisk ).
is-public - A no-dry-run that indicates whether the image is public.
kernel-id - The kernel ID.
manifest-location - The location of the image manifest.

tag :key =*value* - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.
tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter "tag-key=Purpose" and the filter "tag-value=X", you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag :key =*value* filter.
tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.
virtualization-type - The virtualization type (paravirtual | hvm ).
